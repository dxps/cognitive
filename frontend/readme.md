### Generated project notes

This content is part of the initial readme that was generated with the project.

#### Automatic Tailwind (Dioxus 0.7+)

As of Dioxus 0.7, there no longer is a need to manually install tailwind. Simply `dx serve` and you're good to go!

Automatic tailwind is supported by checking for a file called `tailwind.css` in your app's manifest directory (next to Cargo.toml). To customize the file, use the dioxus.toml:

```toml
[application]
tailwind_input = "my.css"
tailwind_output = "assets/out.css"
```

#### Tailwind Manual Install

To use tailwind plugins or manually customize tailwind, you can can install the Tailwind CLI and use it directly.

1. Install npm: https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm
2. Install the Tailwind CSS CLI: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/tailwind-cli
3. Run the following command in the root of the project to start the Tailwind CSS compiler:

```bash
npx @tailwindcss/cli -i ./input.css -o ./assets/tailwind.css --watch
```

#### Serving Your App

Run the following command in the root of your project to start developing with the default platform:

```bash
dx serve --platform web
```

To run for a different platform, use the `--platform platform` flag. E.g.

```bash
dx serve --platform desktop
```
